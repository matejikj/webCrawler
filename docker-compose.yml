# You should know that docker-composes works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a service maybe, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:
  server:
    # The keyword "build" will allow you to define
    # the path to the Dockerfile to use to create the image
    # that will allow you to execute the service.
    # Here 'server/' corresponds to the path to the server folder
    # that contains the Dockerfile to use.
    build: server/
    # Remember that we defined in'server/server.py' 1234 as port.
    # If we want to access the server from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the content port with our computer's port.
    # To do this, the keyword 'ports' will help us.
    # Its syntax is as follows: [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # In our case, we want to use port 1234 on our machine and
    # retrieve port 1234 from the container (because it is on this port that
    # we broadcast the server).
    ports:
      - 8083:8083

  # Second service (container): the client.
  # We use the keyword 'client' for the server.
  client:
    # Here 'client/ corresponds to the path to the client folder
    # that contains the Dockerfile to use.
    build: client/

    # The keyword 'network_mode' is used to define the network type.
    # Here we define that the container can access to the 'localhost' of the computer.
    network_mode: host

    # The keyword'depends_on' allows you to define whether the service
    # should wait until other services are ready before launching.
    # Here, we want the 'client' service to wait until the 'server' service is ready.
    depends_on:
      - server
